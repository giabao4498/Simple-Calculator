## Instructions:
A valid expression only contains numbers, spaces, "+", "-", "x", "X", "*", "/", ":", ".", "," and parentheses.

Use "x", "X" or "*" for multiplication.

Use "/" or ":" for division.

Use "." or "," to seperate integer part and decimal part.

You can omit "x", "X" or "*" if there is a number or a ")" before them and a "(" after them. For example: 9(1+3) is valid and it means 9*(1+3), (1+2)(3-4) is also valid and it means (1+2)*(3-4), (8+9)10 is invalid.

When you are in calculator mode, enter "back" to go back to the menu, enter "exit" to exit the application.

When you are in instruction mode, enter "3" or "exit" to exit the application, enter any other strings to go back to the menu.

You can enter commands with both lower-case letters and upper-case letters. For example: "back", "EXIT", "Back", "eXiT".

Valid expressions and commands can only contain spaces at the beginning or at the end. For example: "    1+2*3   ", "   3/3", "1+1      ", " exit ", " bAcK" are valid; "1 + 2", "e xit" are invalid.
